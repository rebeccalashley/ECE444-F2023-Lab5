What are the pros and cons of TDD?

Test driven development allows for the evolution of the application based on what is required of the application, forcing developers to continue checking in with the requirements and design of the application while implementing it. It also inherently causes the production of the code to be more modular and therefore more maintainable, due to the fact that the development happens based on modular testing. It ends up being easier to debug the code when an error occurs since it is being built alongside the tests. 

On the contrary, it can lead to a false sense of security, if the developer jumps to the conclusion that just because the code passes the test, means that it is free of issues. That is not always the case. Tests might not be written to cover all edge cases. It also requires extra workload, which could be a deterrent for developers, since it takes away from the actual application development. It might not always be suitable, depending on the type of project, such as ones with rapidly changing requirements.
